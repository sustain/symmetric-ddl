# symmetric-ddl

`symmetric-ddl` is a java library for working with Database Definition (DDL). 
It's a fork of [Apache DdlUtuls](https://db.apache.org/ddlutils/) created by [JumpMind](https://github.com/JumpMind)

JumpMind does not seem to have the sources in their github, so I imported and tagged all versions from 2.1.0 to 2.5.13 from maven sources.
